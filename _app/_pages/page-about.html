<h1>Chris Coles</h1>
<p>I am a creator, first. I love writing code. I am driven by empowering people through creating intuitive technological solutions.</p>
<p>I enjoy the constant challenge that crafting flexible, modular code poses. I believe that simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication and the solutions that are created should be as intuitive as they are powerful.</p>
<h2><b>P</b>erfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.</h2>
  <p>Writing good code is like writing a book.</p>
  <p>You begin with a word. Compose a few more words and you will have a sentence. Write another sentence and, <b>stop.</b>
  <p>Rewrite those sentences until perfection has been achieved. Repeat, and soon those sentences turn in to paragraphs, paragraphs into pages and pages into books.</p>
  <p>Creation is incremental and purposeful.</p>
