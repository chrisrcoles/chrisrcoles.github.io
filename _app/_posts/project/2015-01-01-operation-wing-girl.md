Operation Wing Girl was recently created and has organically grown through Atlanta since its inception. The company has great ambitions of spreading throughout the nation to become the go-to social network for women of a broad range of backgrounds and professions seeking to connect with other women of similar interests; to expand their existing circle of friends; to expose themselves to new experiences in a supportive setting. The mission at Operation Wing Girl is to empower women by connecting them to others who want to do what they want to do -- when they want to do it. As the lead engineer for this project, I am responsible for creating and scaling the initial web application.
